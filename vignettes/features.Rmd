```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(clasifierrr)
library(EBImage)
```

```{r}
base_image <- readImageBw(system.file(
            "extdata", "4T1-shNT-1.png",
            package = "clasifierrr"))
display(base_image, method = "raster")
```

The features are just a series of filters applied to the main image.
So it converts an image of heigh y and length x into a data frame of `x * y`
number of rows and one column per feature.

```{r}
feature_df <- calc_features(
    base_image, 
    filter_widths = c(3, 15, 31),
    shape_sizes = c(101, 201, 301, 551))
head(feature_df)
```

you can see the features that were calculated by using the following function

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=12}
display_filters(feature_df, dims = dim(base_image))
display_filters(feature_df, dims = dim(base_image), scale = TRUE)
```
